## Description
This is a real estate website that provides homebuyers, renters and brokers with a  platform to streamline the transaction process in a convenient and efficient way. 

Homebuyers and property renters are able to look through listings and search for ones that correspond to their critera of pricing, location, number of bedrooms and amenities. Once signed in to their accounts, buyers and renters can add these properties to a list of favourite properties that will be saved for them to consult at a later time. Additionially, buyers and renters are able to contact brokers and book visit appointments for houses that peek their interest. 

Brokers using this website will be able to submit offers and request appointments on behalf of their clients and keep track of these offers and appointments. This platform also allows brokers to add new listings, edit them, and remove them from public view as they please (CRUD operations). Lastly, the brokers are able to manage (reschedule/cancel) the appointments that are requested from them.

## Technology Assessment 

Front-End: We had to choose between React, Angular and Vue. The reason why we chose to proceed with React is because mose of our team is familiar with JavaScript, as opposed to Angular which is a TypeScript framework. Moreover, it is the most popular front-end framework. 

Back-End: We had to choose between Express.js, Spring and Django. We chose to stick with Express because it is closely related to Javascript and many of our teammates are familiar with Node.js. The reason why we didn't chose Spring is because we are building a web application and we want to try something other than Java. Lastly, we didn't choose Django because we don't have much experience with Python.
